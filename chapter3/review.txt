1. What is meant by the term prompt?
Example: cout << "Enter your name!"; This message encourages the user to enter value. 
This is called prompt.

2. Which operator do you use to read into a variable?
Operator >>
Example: cin >>

3. If you want the user to input an integer value into your program for a variable named number,
what are two lines of code you could write to ask the user to do it and to input the value into
your program?
cout << "Enter your number!";
int num;
cin >> num;

4. What is \n called and what purpose does it serve?
The \n is a “special character” indicating a newline.

5. What terminates input into a string?
whitespace 

6. What terminates input into an integer?
whitespace or an input that is not an integer.

7. How would you write
cout << "Hello, ";
cout << first_name;
cout << "!\n";
as a single line of code?
cout << "Hello," << first_name << "!\n";

8. What is an object?
An object is a region of memory with a type that specifies what kind of information can be placed in it.

9. What is a literal?
In C++, string literals are delimited by double quotes ("); that is, "Hello, World!\n" is a string
of characters.

10. What kinds of literals are there?
Integer literal - Decimal, Octal, Hex, Binary
Floating point literal - contains a decimal point (.), an exponent (e.g., e3), or a floating-point suffix (d or f)
Boolean literal - true or false
Character literal - a character enclosed in single quotes
String literal - series of characters enclosed in double quotes
Pointer literal - null pointer

11. What is a variable?
A named object is called a variable.
For example, character strings are put into string variables and integers are put into int variables.

12. What are typical sizes for a char, an int, and a double?
char 	- 1 Byte
int 	- 4 Bytes
double 	- 8 bytes

13. What measures do we use for the size of small entities in memory, such as ints and strings?
For ints we use usually 4 bytes which are 32 bits. 
A string is of variable size with its length stored and made up of single characters 
that require each 1 byte of memory.

14. What is the difference between = and ==?
assignment operator and equality operator

15. What is a definition?
A statement that introduces a new name into a program and sets aside memory for a variable is called
a definition

16. What is an initialization and how does it differ from an assignment?
Initialization (giving a variable its initial value)
Assignment (giving a variable a new value)

17. What is string concatenation and how do you make it work in C++?
concatenation is joining strings together.
string s1,s2;
string s = s1+s2;

18. Which of the following are legal names in C++? If a name is not legal, why not?
This_little_pig => legal
This_1_is fine => legal
2_For_1_special => illugal as it begins with number 2
latest thing the_$12_method ==> illegal as it has dollar signal
_this_is_ok ==> legal
MiniMineMine ==> legal 
number  ==> legal
correct? ==> illegal as it has ?

19. Give five examples of legal names that you shouldn’t use because they are likely to cause
confusion.
a. Programmer can get confused from standard library
int String = 2; // Similar to string
double Int = 1.2; // Similar to int
double Double = 1.2; // Similar to doulbe
b. reserved keywords
int Static = 42;
c. Avoid names that are easy to mistype, misread, or confuse
d. Avoid acronyms and abbreviations
e. Overly short names (x, i) and longely names.

20. What are some good rules for choosing names?
names that will help people understand your program

21. What is type safety and why is it important?
Every object is given a type when it is defined.
A program or a part of a program is type-safe when objects are used only according to the rules for their type. 

22. Why can conversion from double to int be a bad thing?
Loss of data (accuracy) happens here. When int is intended, whn double is used memory wastage.

23. Define a rule to help decide if a conversion from one type to another is safe or unsafe.
A conversion is unsafe when the memory reserved for the destination type is lesser than the source datataype.
