- Computation is solving the expressions often called as programs
- To compute we need inputs.
- Inputs can be from keyboard, sensors
- Outputs are display or input to other device etc.
- Job of programer: Express the computations correctly, simply, efficiently.
- Tools for organizing the program:
	- Abstraction - hiding the unnecessary details
	- Divide and conquer
- Whne building a big software, structure and organization matters a lot.
- Expressions compute value from operands-
- A simple expression is the initialization of literal. int length = 5;
- Over use of parenthesis in expression damage the readability. USe wisely.
- Give meaningful name for constants.
- Prefer not to sue literals in the code.
- Non obvious lieratls in code is called magic constants. Avoid it!
- A 'constexpr' symbolic constant must be given a value that must be known at compiletime.
constexpr int pi = 3.142899
- Constants that are unknown during compile time can be intialized as 'const'.
- After initialization, 'const' do not change.
const int c = n+1;
- Any mathematical operator can be used to build any compley expresssion.
- ++a is preferred increment operator
- a*=s is prefereed for multiplication and then assignment.
- conversions: type(value) , type{value}
- type(value) Example 5/2 = 2 where 5/2.0 = 2.5
- type{value} prevents narrowing down.
